# Description

The team generator helps put in data that will allow you to store coworkers' IDs, Emails, Github, schools, and many more. The cards are color-coded depending on what their role is in the company. Let's say you're a contractor, or if you're trying to remember which department they belong to. With this tracker, an ID, email or github will allow you to see a card associated with them. By color-coding the roles, you know who's supposed to be doing what without having to check what department they are in.
